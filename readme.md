## Installation Instructions

### macOS

When you first open the app, macOS may show a security warning. This is normal for apps not downloaded from the App Store.

2. Select **"Open"** from the menu
3. In the dialog that appears, click **"Open"**
4. The app will now run, and you won't see this warning again

**Alternative method:**
1. Try to open the app normally
2. Go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security**
3. You'll see a message about the app being blocked
4. Click **"Open Anyway"**

### Windows

Windows Defender may show a security warning. This is normal for new applications.

**To run the app:**
1. Double-click `ExcelCSVConverter.exe`
2. If you see "Windows protected your PC", click **"More info"**
3. Click **"Run anyway"**
4. The app will now run

**If blocked by antivirus:**
- Add an exception for `ExcelCSVConverter.exe` in your antivirus settings
- Or temporarily disable real-time protection while installing
